About Tads and QTads
====================

QTads is a so called "interpreter" for games created with the Text
Adventure Development System, or "Tads" for short, a C-like object
oriented programming language for authoring Interactive Fiction
(similar to the Infocom or Legend Entertainment games, like "Zork").

The Tads compiler creates executables for the Tads Virtual Machine (the
"Tads VM").  QTads is an implementation of this Virtual Machine; it
runs Tads VM programs.

Both Tads 2 as well as Tads 3 games are supported.

QTads is not written from scratch; it uses Mike Roberts' reference
implementations of the Tads VM.

On what systems does it run?
============================

Theoretically, it should run on *any* system for which a version of Qt
exists.  The main targets however are Linux, macOS and Windows.
